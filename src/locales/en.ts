    platform: `I am Ashish Arora, a student at Sheridan College. My journey at Sheridan has been defined by my passion for technology, leadership, and community engagement.

I have actively contributed to the Sheridan community as a Sheridan Student Ambassador, leading campus tours, assisting with recruitment events, and supporting new students during their transition to college life. Additionally, I have volunteered as a New Student Orientation Volunteer and taken part in sustainability initiatives through the Mission Zero Free Pop-Up Shop.

One of the issues I am most passionate about is enhancing Financial Support: Scholarships, Bursaries, and Awards. As an international student, I have faced firsthand the challenges of rising tuition fees, high living expenses, and limited work opportunities. I believe that simplifying application processes, improving financial literacy, and establishing robust emergency financial assistance programs will empower all students to overcome financial hurdles and thrive academically.

Furthermore, I'll help find potential sponsorships for branch events and collaborate with the VP Internal to facilitate communication with various student groups at Sheridan.

I believe my dedication and experience make me a strong candidate for Board of Directors. I'm eager to hear your ideas and feedback and look forward to working together to create a stronger, more connected ssu community. Thank you for considering my candidacy, and I hope to earn your support in the upcoming election.`,
